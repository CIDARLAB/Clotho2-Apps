        <hr size="1">
        <p>The purpose of this program is to help the user design a reconfigurable circuit
            plasmid (which is sometimes referred to as a "construct") which contains a set of
            permutable parts defined by the user.  This circuit plasmid utilizes the inversion
            capabilites of invertases to reconfigure the set of parts into any permutation.</p>
        <p>To do this, the user defines
            a set of parts which will be permuted.  Then, the user selects a set of permutations of these parts.
            With this information, Trumpet uses a set of algorithms to return a circuit plasmid to the user.
            which contains all of the parts of interest as well as all of the invertase sites necessary for
            flipping sections of the plasmid so that the desired permutations can be achieved.  Trumpet
            also returns a table of desired permutations and their respective "invertase keys".  These keys are
            the sequence of invertases which must be added to the circuit plasmid so that the circuit plasmid will reconfigure
            to the corresponding permutation.</p>
        <p>The algorithms used by Trumpet are by no means completely optimized.  I hope that this app can act as
            a stepping stone to further invertase inversion algorithm development.
        </p>
        This user manual begins by describing Trumpet's user interface.  It also steps the
        user through the plasmid design process by explaining each step in detail.  Finally,
        this document helps the user find more information regarding Clotho and app development.</p>

    <font size="5"><i><b>2.  GUI Layout</b></i></font>
    <hr size="1">
    <p>
        This section of the user manual will describe the basic GUI components of Trumpet.
        Hopefully by reading this portion, you will become familiar with Trumpet's
        interface, which will make the next section of this manual, "Designing a Plasmid"
        easier to follow.</p>

    <br>
    <b>Menu Bar</b>
    <p>Located at the top of the Trumpet GUI is the menu bar.  This consist of four
        drop down menus.  The first is the File Menu: </p>
    <br>
    <center>
        <img border="0" src="FileMenu.png" alt="File Menu"  />
    </center>
    <p>This menu only contains the option to exit the program.  The second item in
        the menu bar is the Windows Menu:</p>
    <br>
    <center>
        <img border="0" src="WindowsMenu.png" alt="Windows Menu"  />
    </center>
    <p>This menu contains three options.  All three of these options toggle certain
        tabs on and off within the Work Space.  The option is titled "Simulate Designs".
        This allows you to open and close the Simulate Designs tab of the work space.
        Unfortunately, for the first version of Trumpet, the design simulator has not been
        implemented, so this feature merely opens and closes a tab which holds no value.</p>
    <p>The other two options, Show Trees and Show Key Tables, toggle the Invertase Key
        Trees and Key Tables on and off.  These will be explained in greater detail later in
        this user manual.</p>
    <p>The next menu is the Views menu:
        <br>
    <center>
        <img border="0" src="ViewsMenu.png" alt="Views Menu"  />
    </center>
    <p>The only item in this menu, Switch Views, allows you to move Trumpet between it's
        own window and the FabDash IDE.  Lastly, there is the Help menu.</p>
    <br>
    <center>
        <img border="0" src="HelpMenu.png" alt="Help Menu"  />
    </center>
    <p>This menu has two options.  The first enables you to view this document, which means you must have already
        explored this menu.  The second informs you of the version of Trumpet that you are using.</p>
    <br>
    <b>Part Toolbar</b>
    <br>
    <p>
        Located at to the left of the Trumpet GUI is your Part Toolbar:</p>
    <br>
    <center>
        <img border="0" src="PartToolbar.png" alt="Part Toolbar"  />
    </center>
    <p>The Part Toolbar allows you to choose your part format and set of parts.
        It also shows you what invertases are available by updating the "Available Invertases"
        list by referencing your current database.  Currently, the invertases are hard-coded; however,
        soon Clotho will allow for recombinase families.  When this occurs, this list will be fixed.</p>
    <br>
    <b>Work Space</b>
    <p>Below is an image of the Trumpet work space:</p>
    <br>
    <center>
        <img border="0" src="WorkSpaceResized.png" alt="Work Space"/>
    </center>

    <p>The Work Space allows the user to choose a set of desired permutations, given
        the part set defined in the Part Toolbar.  The work space also contains the set
        of algorithms from which the user can choose from.  These algorithms determine how
        the invertases are placed within the plasmid construct.  They will be discussed in further
        detail in Section 4 of this user manual.</p>
    <p>It is also important to note that the Work Space will house all of the generated
        results.  These will be added as separate tabs within the Work Space.  Result tabs
        will be further explored in the following section.</p>

    <font size="5"><i><b>3.  Designing a Plasmid</b></i></font>
    <hr size="3">
    <p>This portion of the user manual thoroughly describes how to use Trumpet
        for it's intended purpose.  This section will guide you through each step of the
        circuit plasmid design process.  Hopefully by reading this tutorial, you'll
        not only understand how to use Trumpet, but you'll be able to use Trumpet to it's
        full design capability.</p>

    <ol>
        <b><li>Choose a Format</li></b>
        <p>At the end of the day, Trumpet will create a composite part in Clotho, which
            you will be able to save to your database connection.  In order to make a composite
            part, all of the parts within the composite part must be of the same format.  Due
            to this, the first thing you must do while using Trumpet is choose the part format
            that you will work with.  In the top left corner of Trumpet's GUI, you should see
            the following drop down menu: </p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <img border="0" src="ChoosingFormat.png" alt="Choose a Format"  />
        </center>
        <p>For this step of the design process, all you need to do is choose a format from
            this drop down menu.  This will be your current working format for the rest of the manual. </p>
        <b><li>Choose Your Set of Parts</li></b>
        <p>Next, you need to define your set of parts.  These will be the parts that you
            are interested in permuting.  To add a part, simply click on the part of interest
            in the FabDash's workspace pictured below:</p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <img border="0" src="DragAndDropResized.png" alt="Choose your parts"  />
        </center>
        <p>After clicking on your part, just drag and drop this part into the Current
            Part Set of Trumpet, which can be found in the Part Toolbar.  When you drag a
            part into the Current Part Set, Trumpet will check to see whether this part
            agrees with your current format.  If it does not, Trumpet will let you know that
            this is the case, and the part will not be added.  When a part does get added,
            it will be added to the Current Part Set and it will be indexed in this list
            with "P#: " where the P simply stand for part.  This indexing will make more sense
            when you define your desired set of permutations.  For now, it is not very important.
            Below is an example of the Current Part Set which contains 4 parts: </p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <img border="0" src="PartSet.png" alt="Choose your parts"  />
        </center>
        <p>Once parts have been added to your Current Part Set, they can be deleted at
            any time.  Simply click on the part in your part set so that it is highlighted.
            Then click the delete button located directly below the list of current parts.  When
            you click this delete button, any parts highlighted in your Current Part Set will
            be deleted.</p>
        <br>
        <b><li>Choose Whether to Differentiate Inversions</li></b>
        Once you have your set of parts, the next step (which may not be very intuitive)
        is to determine whether you want Trumpet to distinguish between inverted parts
        and non-inverted parts.  The check box for this option is located in the lower right
        corner of Trumpet near the Go button:
        <center>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="Inversions.png" alt="Inversions"  />
        </center>
        <p>When parts of a construct are inverted using invertases, the parts will end up being flipped.
            If you are only interested in permuting parts, and you do not care whether the
            permutation contains parts which are flipped, then you should deselect this check box.
            If you are interested in permutations where certain parts are flipped and others are not, then
            leave this box checked.  This is the default option, since most users will be
            interested in flipping parts on and off.</p>
        <br>
        <b><li>Choose Your Permutations</li></b>
        <p>You are finally ready to choose your set of desired permutations!  As you add
            parts to your Current Part Set, the list of Possible Permutations is updated.  Below
            is an example of the Possible Permutations list with a Current Part Set containing
            four parts:</p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <img border="0" src="PossiblePermsInv.png" alt="Choose your permutations"  />
        </center>
        <p>Looking at this figure, you can see that each part is now referenced by its
            index "P#".  The list of Possible Permutations contains all possible permutations of
            the four parts.  In the example above, the "Include Inverted Parts" check box has
            been checked.  Because of this, the Possible Permutations list also includes all
            permutations with each part turned flipped and not flipped.  This is indicated using
            the "'" character after the part index.  For example, the first permutation in the list
            is "P1' P2 P3 P4".  This permutation simply inverts only the first part of your Current
            Part Set.  If this check box was not checked, the Possible Permutation list would
            look like the following:</p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <img border="0" src="PossiblePermsNonInv.png" alt="Possible Permutations"  />
        </center>
        <p>At this point, your Desired Permutation list should be empty.  Your work space
            should look like the following:</p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <img border="0" src="ChoosePermutationsResized.png" alt="ChoosePermutations"  />
        </center>
        <p>To add a permutation to your list of Desired Permutations, simply click on
            one or more (use Shift or Ctrl to highlight more than one) permutations in the
            Possible Permutations list.  Then, click the Add button located between the
            Possible Permutations and Desired Permutations list.  If you attempt to add
            the same permutation more than once, Trumpet will not add this permutation,
            however, it will also not let you know that you have tried to add the same
            permutation.  This is done so as to avoid bringing up annoying dialogs for such
            a small mistake made by the user.</p>
        <br>
        <b><li>Choose an Algorithm</li></b>
        <p>With your set of Desired Permutations defined, you are ready to choose your
            algorithm.  So far, Trumpet contains two different algorithms called LinkSort
            and Pancake.  Both of these algorithms attempt to place invertase sites in your
            construct, so that only the permutations you desire will be hit.  These algorithms
            are by no means the optimal solutions to invertase site placement.  If you are
            interested in how these algorithms determine where to place invertase sites,
            please refer to section 5 titled "Algorithms".</p>
        <p>To choose which algorithm you would like to use, select one of them from the
            radio buttons located at the bottom of the Trumpet GUI: </p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <img border="0" src="ChooseAlgorithm.png" alt="Choose an algorithm"  />
        </center>
        <p>Since these two algorithms operate differently, it may be beneficial to
            the user to try using both for the same set of desired permutations.  They will
            most likely generate different results with different properties.  Depending on
            what properties of the construct you are interested in, each one may have it's
            ups and downs.</p>
        <br>
        <b><li>Generate Results</li></b>
        <p>Finally, you are ready to generate your construct, or composite part.  To do this,
            simply press the Go button located in the lower right corner of the Trumpet GUI: </p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <img border="0" src="Go.png" alt="Click Go!"  />
        </center>
        <p>After pressing this button, a Result tab is generated in your work space.
            The following section of this user manual will describe how to interpret all of
            the different pieces of a Result tab.</p>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <font size="5"><i><b>4.  Interpreting Results</b></i></font>
    <hr size="3">
    <p>When a Result tab is generated, after following the steps outlined above,
        it will contain four of it's own tabs.  Each of these tabs contains information
        pertaining the construct which Trumpet has designed.  This section will explain
        all of this information, piece by piece.</p>
    <ol>
        <b><li>Quick Summary</li></b>
        <p>The Quick Summary will be the first thing that you see when a Result tab is
            generated.  It is located at the top of the Result tab and is visible from any
            of the result's inner tabs.  The Quick Summary is meant to be a quick reference
            when looking at many different result tabs in your work space.  It reminds you
            what algorithm was used to create the circuit plasmid, the number of total permutations
            that can be achieved with the construct, and the total number of invertases necessary
            to make the construct.</p>
        <br>
        <b><li>Design Summary</li></b>
        <p>The first tab, within the Result tab, is a simple summary of the plasmid that
            has been designed.  An example using four parts is shown below: </p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <img border="0" src="DesignSummaryResized.png" alt="Design Summary"  />
        </center>
        <p>This tab is split up into three sections: Construct Summary, Permutation Summary,
            and Parts Summary.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Construct Summary</li>
            <p>The construct summary contains three valuable pieces of information.  The first
                is simply the algorithm that was used.  The second is the total number of invertases
                required to hit all of the desired permutations.  The final piece of information, the String Design, in this
                section is a little more complicated. The String Design represents the composite part which Trumpet
                has created.  Each substring within this long string represents a part of the design.  Any of the
                strings that begin with "I" are an invertase site.  The number that follows this "I" is the identifier for
                that invertase site, as well as it's corresponding invertase inputs.  Any of the strings that begin with "P" represent
                a part (this is again referring to the indexing of the Current Part Set).  Any string which ends with
                the "'" indicates that this part has been flipped.  For example each invertase site must contain a
                complementary invertase site.  The complementary sites are simply flipped, so they are represented
                using this "'" character.  If the construct contained flipped parts, they would also have a "'" concatenated
                at the end of the "P#".  This will come up again later in this section of the user manual. </p>
            <li>Permutation Summary</li>
            <p>The permutation summary begins with the Number of Levels required by this design. This number corresponds to the
                length of the longest invertase key generated for this design.  The term level corresponds to the Invertase Tree
                described later in this section.  The Permutation Summary also includes the number of desired permutations
                as well as the total number of permutations hit.  These two numbers may differ to the nature of the
                algorithms.  Sometimes, on the way to a desired permutation, the construct may reconfigure into an intermediate
                permutation that was not desired.  Finally, this section includes the starting permutation of the
                parts within the circuit plasmid.  This is base configuration of the plasmid before it undergoes
                any inversions.</p>
            <li>Parts Summary</li>
            <p>The Parts Summary specifies the format of all parts involved in the plasmid.  It
                also displays the indexing for the parts being permuted.</p>
        </ul>
        <b><li>Invertase Key Table</li></b>
        <p>The second tab within the Result tab is the Invertase Key Table shown below:</p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <img border="0" src="KeyTableResized.png" alt="Table of keys"  />
        </center>
        <p>The left column of this table contains the set of desired permutation that you chose
            earlier.  The right column of this table shows the invertase key for each permutation.  This
            invertase key represents the sequence of invertases that, when added to the base circuit
            plasmid, will reconfigure the circuit plasmid into the corresponding permutation.</p>
        <b><li>Invertase Tree</li></b>
        <p>The third Result tab contains the same information as the invertase key table; however,
            it displays these keys in a tree format.  Each node in the tree represents a permutation, and
            each edge represents an invertase input.  The root of the tree is the circuit plasmid's base
            permutation of parts.  By traversing the tree, you can see what permutations are hit on the
            way to a desire permutation.  Below is an example of this tree: </p>
        <br>
        <center>

        <p>The tree is color coded.  Desired permutations are blue nodes.  Intermediate permutations
            are orange nodes.  You can use the mouse wheel to zoom.  There is also a set of controls located
            at the bottom of the tree display.  There are plus/minus zoom buttons in the center.  On the left
            is the Radial button.  This converts the natural tree layout into a concentric radial tree layout.  In this
            format, the center circle represents the base construct.  All permutations that lie a single inversion
            away from the base circuit plasmid, are placed on the next largest of the circles, and so on and so forth.
            This view helps visualize how many inversions away certain desired permutations may be from the circuit plasmid
            (which again, is equivalent to the Number of Levels from the Design Summary).</p>
        <p>To the right of the zoom buttons, there is a combo box with two viewing modes: Transforming and Picking.
            Each mode has a set of associated controls.  In the Transforming mode, which is the default mode, you can
            move the graph around the screen by simply clicking and dragging.  In conjunction with this, by holding control at
            the same time, you are able to skew the graph.  Similarly, holding shift will rotate the graph.  In the Picking
            mode, you can click on individual nodes and drag them around to different areas.  You are also able to
            highlight many nodes at once by clicking and dragging, from corner to corner, a square around the set of nodes.
            Once these nodes are selected, they can be moved around as a group by clicking on one of them.  Both the
            Picking and Transforming modes are available in the tree and radial layouts.</p>
        <b><li>Save and Export</li></b>
        <p>The last tab within the Result Tab is allows you to save your design to your Clotho database.
            The figure below shows a an example of the Save and Export tab:</p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <img border="0" src="SaveAndExportResized.png" alt="Save your construct"  />
        </center>
        <p>The top of this tab allows you to enter the name of your construct as well as a
            description of this construct.  Below this is the invertase assignment panel.  This panel
            is split into two columns.  The left column is a list of the invertases used in your design.
            These invertases can be found in the String Design on the Design Summary tab.
            Each of these invertases has a corresponding combo box in the right column of the panel.  These drop down
            boxes are populated with a list of invertase sites in your Clotho database.  All of these possible sites
            can also be found in the Part Toolbar underneath the Current Part Set.</p>
        <p>If you attempt to save a the circuit plasmid without filling in the name or description,
            a dialog box will inform you that this is not possible.  Also, if you assign the same invertase to more
            than one invertase name, Trumpet will warn you.  If all of the fields are filled in properly and
            you save the construct, the saving process will run in the background.  When the part is finally saved, a
            dialog box will pop up and inform you.</p>
        <b><li>Create Construct from a Tree</li></b>
        <p>When Trumpet generates a construct, it may require large Number of Levels which
            might make the construct unappealing to the user.  Below is an example of this problem:</p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <img border="0" src="LongTreeResized.png" alt="too long!"  />
        </center>
        <p>In order to hit "P4 P2 P3 P1", 8 inversions are required.  If instead, we started at permutation
            "P4' P2' P3' P1'", 7 separate desired permutations could be achieved with only 4 levels of inversion.
            By right clicking this node, a pop up appears with the option "Create Construct":</p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <img border="0" src="CreateConstruct.png" alt="create a construct!"  />
        </center>
        <p>By clicking this option, a new circuit plasmid is generated with this permutation
            as the circuit plasmid's base configuration.  This plasmid can be reconfigured to any of
            the permutations that were underneath that node from the original construct's tree.  Imagine that the
            original tree is cut at the selected node (permutation).  The subtree extending from this node is the
            newly generated construct:</p>

        <center>
            <img border="0" src="NewTree.png" alt="new tree"  />
        </center>
        <p>The picture above shows the Invertase Key Tree of the newly created circuit plasmid</p>
        <p>That's it!  Have fun designing!</p>
